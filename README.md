# sqlalchemy-challenge
##Description
This is my submission for the sql-alchemy challenge. This project aims to improve my skills with sqlalcehmy and give me practice connecting to databases from a python script using Flask. 

## Usage
To run the script you need to make sure that you have the proper dependencies installed, then just open up the Jupyter notebook and run it cell by cell. 

To run the flask app just open your terminal and navigate to the "SurfsUp" directory and run "flask run" in the terminal. You should be able to follow all of the provided endpoints and see the proper data.
